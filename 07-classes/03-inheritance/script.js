// notes:
// The static keyword defines a static method or property for a class. Static members (properties and methods) are called without instantiating their class and cannot be called through a class instance. 
// Static methods are often used to create utility functions for an application, whereas static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be replicated across instances. (MDN)

// The extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another class. !!! If there is a constructor present in the subclass, it needs to first call super() before using "this". !!! (MDN)

// The super keyword is used to call corresponding methods of super class. This is one advantage over prototype-based inheritance. (MDN)
